# Ergo-App Client

This is the client for the Ergo-App project, a full-stack application with a frontend client and a backend server. This client is built with React, Redux Toolkit, Redux Saga, Styled Components, and TypeScript, and is intended to be run locally.

## Built With

The following tools were used in the building of the client:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - A library that aims to make application side effects easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Visual primitives for the component age
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - An open-source language which builds on JavaScript, by adding static type definitions

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the client up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

1. Navigate into the `client` directory:

    ```bash
    cd your_repository/client
    ```

2. Install NPM packages for the client:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the client:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The client should now be running on your local machine. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Building for Production
